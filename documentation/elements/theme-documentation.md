### Theming

Changing Vuero colors is now a bit more complicated than before but we will
point you to the right files so everything remains as easy as before. To
customize Vuero base colors, which are used to generate all derived ones, you
need to edit `src/bulma-css-vars.config.js`. There you can edit all the
`primary` and other related base variables. Please note that we also switched
the base notation to `HSL` in replacement of `HEX`.
