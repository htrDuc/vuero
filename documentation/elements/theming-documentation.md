### Customizing CSS Variables

We created a new folder and some bew files in `src/scss/css-variables`. There,
we use a new utility mixin `src/scss/css-variables/_mixins.scss` to generate
all our colors in the other files. Please also note that you can also
customize font variables and corner radiuses at runtime.
